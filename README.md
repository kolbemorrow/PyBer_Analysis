# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
An analysis of PyBer ride share data comparing Rural, Suburban and Urban cities' metrics from January to April. These include total rides, total drivers, total fares, the average fare per ride and per driver. 
### PyBer Fare By City Type Summary:
![PyBer_fare_summary_df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99298165/164895915-bd8676c8-d9c4-49e1-a5fc-c3e49b150817.png)

For Rural cities the total rides are 125, the total drivers are 78 and the total fares are $4,327.93. The Rural average fare per ride is $34.62 and per driver is $55.49. For Suburban cities the total rides are 625, the total drivers are 490 and the total fares are $19,356.33. The Suburban average fare per ride is $30.97 and per driver is $39.50. For Urban cities the total rides are 1,625, the total drivers are 2,405 and the total fares are $39,854.38. The Urban average fare per ride is $24.53 and per driver is $16.57.
Based on these calculations, Urban cities have the most rides, drivers and the highest amount of fares overall. Rural cities have the least rides, drivers and lowest fares overall. Rural and Suburban cities maintain similar average fares, while Urban cities are slightly lower compared. Rural cities have a significantly higher average fare per driver compared to Suburban and Urban cities. Rural cities have the lowest overall usage but the highest average fare per ride and driver.

### Election-Audit Summary: 
In order to mitigate the disparities between city types some changes should be made for users specific to their location's city type. Rural users would need more drivers available at a consistent rate to reduce the average fares per driver, perhaps also a maximum fixed rate cost. Urban cities have the greatest fluctuation in fare over time. In order to mitigate this issue for riders an algorithm could be created to predict ride usage per week to prompt an incentive for more drivers to become available for rides. This prediction could also be provided to users for them to plan trips around peak ride sharing availability times.
